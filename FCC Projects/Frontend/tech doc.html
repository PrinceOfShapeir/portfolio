	<p>
	Simple Counting. <br>
	
	The reason we learn binary is because everyone is already using it. 
	It's not so hard as you think.</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	Let's take a look at the number 268. It has three places and no 
	decimal. If we say that 1 indicates the presence of a digit at the 
	place, then the sequence 111 would indicate a number has three 
	digits. Under a Simple Counting model, all you'd have to do is 
	repeat the pattern a maximum of 8 times (8 is the highest digit), for the 
	following sequence: <br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<table>
			
			<tr>001</tr>
			<tr>001</tr>
			<tr>011</tr>
			<tr>011</tr>
			<tr>011</tr>
			<tr>011</tr>
			<tr>111</tr>
			<tr>111</tr>
			<tr>268</tr>
			</table>
	</p>
	<p>
	Simple, right? Yet also very tedious. What we are looking for is a 
	more compact way of expressing numbers. One way of doing this is multiplicative.
	What we have here is battery, and that battery will store avalue for you, 
	but you have to charge it up, starting from right to left.  
	
	<br>
	The first bit on the right should be 1. If it isn't 1 then you have 
	0. Simple, right? Let's skip on to 2.
	
	<br>
	The second bit on the right stores 2^1, which is just 2. So 
	what can we do? Let's see what happens when we put 1 in the 
	two-place. 
	
	<table>
		
		<tr>11<tr>
		<tr>2+1=3</tr>
		
		Oh no. 2 + 1 is not 2, but 3. But, we know where the extra 1 is. 
		It's in the 1 place. We just delete that. Now our 2 bit number 
		looks like this: <br>
		
		<table>
			<tr>10
				</tr>
				<tr>=2<tr>
				</table>
				<br>
		2 plus 0 equals 2. We are now smart enough to count to 2. Yay. 
		And if we put the 1 back, we can also count to 3.
		<br>
		
		Counting to 4:
		
		Since 4>3, we need to add another bit. The third bit has the 
		value of 2^2 or 2*2, which if you might be wondering equals 4. 
		We're already done. Just put 1 in the 3-place.
		<br>
		<table>
			<tr>100</tr>
			<tr>2^2=4</tr>
			</table>
	<br>
	Since we know how to count to 3, we can just add that to make any 
	number up to 7.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	<b>Counting additional numbers</b>
	<br>
	Now remember when you learned powers of 2 in school? I don't 
	either. Remember to write to your local dignitary, capo chief, 
	member of congress, member of parliament, communist party chair 
	(don't do this, this is actually a bad idea), village elder, or 
	shaman, to complain. 
	
	Fortunately there's only eight of them in an 8 bit binary, so 
	you only have to memorize 8, or 5 assuming you got the last three. 
	You have to memorize five numbers. I am deeply and truly sorry. As 
	a way of apology, I have provided the 2 times table.

		<tr>2^1 = 2</tr>

	<p>
		Quaternary is an extremely useful number system to learn for 
		the sole reason that the nucleotide sequences in DNA 
		are in base-four. Incidentally, base-four is the third closest 
		whole base to <i>e</i> that isn't one, and one is kind of 
		silly. You might be noticing this convergence is less than coincidence.
