//this takes the existing algorithm for level order traversal and reverses it
//it's possible to do this directly, but it would require a rewrite of working code
//Going in order the first time let's us write idempotent code, as index 0 will always refer to the same location.
//in reverse order we can't make that assumption, as every new index causes a rightward shift of the entire output
//If we knew the depth ahead of time, it could be done, but to obtain the depth we would end up traversing the tree anyway
