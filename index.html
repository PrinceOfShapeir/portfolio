	  A little background: In the 90s, PC gaming really was the wild west. I remember
	   going from minesweeper straight to custom boot disks,
	  because that was the only way the game devs could get the thing to
	  run. Imagine doing something like that now: "Tell the five-year-old
	  customer to install twelve floppies in correct order, and interrupt
	  the boot sequence. Patches <s>may or may not arrive my mail</s> <u>will never arrive.</u>" 
	  The game crashed so much I memorized the error codes and had a mental map
	  of when and where they would occur. The Laibon will never stop talking
	  unless you freeze the animation and break the loop. You can bypass
	  cpu bound event triggers by save scumming every second until you've
	  hopped the exception...</mark>
	  
	  <br><br><mark>
	   Truly, it was a simpler time. Having no other experience, I assumed 
	   the dance we played was part of the game. Crashes attained a mystical 
	   quality. When I learned what really went on with scripting I was devastated.
	   What had seemed design was accident, what had seemed spontaneous was design. 
	   This is why I'm an advocate of neural nets. I want to bring the magic back. I 
	   want the user to experience wonder. I want the user to be able to talk 
	   to their AI assistant, and forget Turing tests, I want them to develop in-jokes.
	   I want them to talk back, to have moods, to get salty, to be drowsy when the 
	   battery is slow, to yell for help when you are in trouble, to reschedule your calls,
	   to do your taxes... And I think that human designers should take a hands off approach.
	    Engineering should take a cue from nature which procedurally generates random fluctuations,
	    and filters out 99.<u>99</u>% of them. Some things can't be designed, they are
	    too abstract. Not everyone is ok with that. And these people will have great careers. 
	    A moonshot is not for everyone. But it is for me.</p></mark>-->

	  The AI is a perceptron based multi-layer neural network. As Tic Tac Toe 
	  is a perfect information game, it is not necessary for the AI to have 
	  memory. Nevertheless, the user will notice rapidly changing
	  behavior, starting from the first game onward. The hidden neural layer
	  accumulates affinities to certain combinations. The purpose of this
	  approach is to demonstrate that TTT is solveable through pure pattern
	  recognition. It is a prime candidate given the problem has a proven,
	  mathematical solution. To ensure the blindness of the trial, neither
	  the network nor the programmer have seen a known solution, to prevent
	  its accidental introduction into the training algorithm. </mark>
	  <br>
	  	  <br>
	  <mark>Initial training involves a positive reinforcement cycle on known
	  winning combinations, and a negative reinforcement cycle on random
	  recombinations. The random component introduces fluctuations into the
	  network affinity, which can be assessed experimentally. The testing
	  phase involves a series of one to one matchups, of which only one
	  player survives to the next match. After a player has defeated a 
	  certain number of opponents, it is saved and uploaded to our server. 
	  All AI instances in the database will have undergone this training.
	  </mark><br>
	  	  <br>
	  <mark>User interaction is a vital component of the next phase in training.
	  When a new user loads a fresh AI off our server, it begins training
	  immediately, and assuming the human player is a good one, it will
	  improve. The users themselves are encouraged to direct such training
	  as they see fit, provided they don't edit values directly. At the
	  end of a cycle, users may submit their trained networks to a tournament
	  style battle royale, which selects the default AI for the next cycle.

	  The overarching goal is to find the combination involving the least 
	  neurons and the best performance. This is in keeping with the Least 
	  Intelligence Pledge, which states that no AI should be developed with 
	  intelligence beyond that required for minimum functionality. </mark>
	  <br><br>
	  <mark>The process could go on forever, and the training methodology could 
	  be applied to any pattern recognition program.</mark>
